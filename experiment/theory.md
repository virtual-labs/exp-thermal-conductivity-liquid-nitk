The rate of heat transfer from a surface at a temperature Ts to the surrounding
medium at T<sub>∞</sub> is given by Newton’s law of cooling as:
<br>
<br>
<center>
<strong>
Q<sub>conv</sub> = h *A <sub>s</sub>* (T<sub>s</sub> - T<sub>∞</sub>)
</strong>
</center>
<br>
<br>
where A <sub>s</sub> is the heat transfer surface area and h is the convection heat transfer coefficient.<br>
<br>
When the temperatures T<sub>s</sub> and T<sub>∞</sub> are fixed by design considerations, as is often the case, there are two ways to increase the rate of heat transfer:<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>To increase the convection heat transfer coefficient <strong>h</strong></li>
    <li>To increase the surface area <strong> A <sub>s</sub> </strong>.</li>
</ul>
<br>Increasing h may require the installation of a pump or fan, or
replacing the existing one with a larger one, but this approach may or may not
be practical. 
<br>Besides, it may not be adequate. <br>The alternative is to increase the
surface area by attaching to the surface extended surfaces called fins made of
highly conductive materials such as aluminum.
