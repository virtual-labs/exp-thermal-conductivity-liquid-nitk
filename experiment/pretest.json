      "question": "The temperature distribution along a long fin is given by the equation T = (T<sub>0</sub> - T<sub>∞</sub>)*e<sup>(-mx)</sup>, where T<sub>0</sub> is the base temperature, T<sub>∞</sub> is the surrounding temperature, m is a constant, and x is the distance from the base of the fin. If m increases, what happens to the temperature drop along the length of the fin?",

      "question": "Why is it important to consider the variation of the convection heat transfer coefficient along the fin in the analysis of fins?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because the convection heat transfer coefficient is a strong function of the fluid motion at that point",
        "b": "Because the value of h is usually much lower at the fin base than it is at the fin tip",
