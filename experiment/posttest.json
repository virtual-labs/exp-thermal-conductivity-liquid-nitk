      "question": "The rate of heat transfer from a fin is directly proportional to:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The fin's temperature",
        "b": "The fin's surface area",
        "c": "The fin's color",
        "d": "The fin's thickness"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (b). The temperature difference drives the heat transfer, but it's not directly proportional as it depends on other factors as well.",
        "b": "Correct, the right answer is (b). Heat transfer from a fin primarily occurs through conduction (within the fin material) and convection (from the fin surface to the surrounding fluid). The rate of heat transfer is directly proportional to the fin's surface area because a larger area allows more heat to be transferred by convection.",
        "c": "The right answer is (b). The color of the fin mainly affects radiation heat transfer, which is typically less significant compared to conduction and convection in fins.",
        "d": "The right answer is (b). The thickness of the fin affects its conductive resistance but does not directly relate to the rate of heat transfer in a simple proportional manner."

      "question": "Let us say there are two rods having same dimensions, one made of brass (k = 85W/m K) and the other of copper (k = 375W/m K), having one of their ends inserted into a furnace. At a section 10.5 cm away from the furnace, the temperature of brass rod is 120 degree Celsius. Find the distance at which the same temperature would be reached in the copper rod?
